Certainly! Here are some JavaScript practice questions where you can implement logic :

1. Factorial Calculation: Write a function to calculate the factorial of a given number `n`.

2. Prime Number Checker: Create a function that checks if a given number `n` is a prime number.

3. Palindrome Checker: Implement a function that checks if a given string is a palindrome (reads the same backward as forward).

4. Greatest Common Divisor (GCD): Write a function to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two positive integers.
5. FizzBuzz: Write a function that prints the numbers from 1 to `n`, but for multiples of three, print "Fizz" instead of the number, and for the multiples of five, print "Buzz." For numbers that are multiples of both three and five, print "FizzBuzz."
6. Array Sorting: Implement a function to sort an array of numbers in ascending order using any sorting algorithm.

7. Reverse String: Create a function that takes a string and returns the reverse of that string.
8. Pascal's Triangle: Write a function to generate the first `n` rows of Pascal's Triangle.

9. Check Armstrong Number: Create a function that checks if a given number is an Armstrong number.

10. Check Perfect Number: Implement a function that checks if a given number is a perfect number (sum of its proper divisors is equal to the number).
11. Count Vowels and Consonants: Write a function that counts the number of vowels and consonants in a given string.

12. FizzBuzz Custom: Write a function that prints the numbers from 1 to `n`, but for multiples of `num1`, print "Fizz," and for multiples of `num2`, print "Buzz." For numbers that are multiples of both `num1` and `num2`, print "FizzBuzz."
13. Find the maximum number in an array.
These practice questions will help you reinforce your JavaScript skills and challenge you to think critically when implementing different algorithms and logic. Happy coding and enjoy the learning process!

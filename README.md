Certainly! Here are some JavaScript practice questions where you can implement logic :

1. Factorial Calculation: Write a function to calculate the factorial of a given number `n`.

2. Prime Number Checker: Create a function that checks if a given number `n` is a prime number.

3. Palindrome Checker: Implement a function that checks if a given string is a palindrome (reads the same backward as forward).

4. Greatest Common Divisor (GCD): Write a function to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two positive integers.
5. FizzBuzz: Write a function that prints the numbers from 1 to `n`, but for multiples of three, print "Fizz" instead of the number, and for the multiples of five, print "Buzz." For numbers that are multiples of both three and five, print "FizzBuzz."
6. Array Sorting: Implement a function to sort an array of numbers in ascending order using any sorting algorithm.

7. Reverse String: Create a function that takes a string and returns the reverse of that string.
8. Pascal's Triangle: Write a function to generate the first `n` rows of Pascal's Triangle.

9. Check Armstrong Number: Create a function that checks if a given number is an Armstrong number.

10. Check Perfect Number: Implement a function that checks if a given number is a perfect number (sum of its proper divisors is equal to the number).
11. Count Vowels and Consonants: Write a function that counts the number of vowels and consonants in a given string.

12. FizzBuzz Custom: Write a function that prints the numbers from 1 to `n`, but for multiples of `num1`, print "Fizz," and for multiples of `num2`, print "Buzz." For numbers that are multiples of both `num1` and `num2`, print "FizzBuzz."

These questions will help you practice implementing logic in JavaScript and improve your problem-solving skills. Happy coding!
Absolutely! Here are some additional JavaScript practice questions that involve implementing logic and problem-solving:

1. Anagram Checker: Write a function that checks if two given strings are anagrams of each other.

2. Array Sum and Average: Implement a function that calculates the sum and average of the elements in an array of numbers.

3. Missing Number: Given an array containing `n` distinct numbers taken from 0, 1, 2, ..., n, write a function to find the missing number in the sequence.

4. Palindrome Number Checker: Create a function that checks if a given number is a palindrome (reads the same backward as forward).

5. Find the Second Largest Number: Write a function that finds the second largest number in an array of integers.

6. Reverse Integer: Implement a function that reverses the digits of a given integer.

7. FizzBuzz Advanced: Write a function that prints the numbers from 1 to `n`, but for multiples of `num1`, print "Fizz," for multiples of `num2`, print "Buzz," and for multiples of both `num1` and `num2`, print "FizzBuzz."

8. Count Duplicates in an Array: Create a function that counts the number of duplicate elements in an array.

9. Find the Missing Angle: Given two angles of a triangle (in degrees), write a function that calculates and returns the value of the missing angle.

10. Longest Word in a Sentence: Implement a function that finds and returns the longest word in a given sentence.

11. Binary to Decimal Conversion: Write a function that converts a binary number to its decimal equivalent.

12. Check Leap Year: Create a function that checks if a given year is a leap year.

These practice questions will help you reinforce your JavaScript skills and challenge you to think critically when implementing different algorithms and logic. Happy coding and enjoy the learning process!
